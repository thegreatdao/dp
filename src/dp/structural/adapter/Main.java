 * Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, 
 * or maps, the old component to the new system. Clients call methods on 
 * the Adapter object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component. 
 * This strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with aggregation.
 * Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class. It provides 
 * a different or translated view of that class.
